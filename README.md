# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes seem to be correctly implemented, but don't render as expected.

## Bug Report

The provided example demonstrates a `hover` effect on a `div`.  Despite the correct class names, the hover state does not change the background color.

## Solution

The problem might be caused by several factors:

* **Missing or incorrect configuration:** Ensure that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and that the CSS file is correctly imported into your project.
* **Conflicting styles:** Check for any conflicting CSS styles that might be overriding the Tailwind classes.
* **Typographical errors:**  Double-check for typos in the class names.
* **Incorrect build process:**  If you are using a build process (e.g., Vite, Webpack), make sure it's configured correctly to process Tailwind CSS.
* **Parent element issues:** Sometimes, a parent element's styling can interfere. Try inspecting the parent element to see if anything unexpected is affecting the child.
* **Incorrect import:** Verify that the Tailwind directives are correctly imported into your JavaScript files. 

The solution provided includes fixes to address potential causes.  Review the code carefully for the correct implementation.
